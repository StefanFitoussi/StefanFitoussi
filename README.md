# Welcome world! This is my GitHub-Hub :sunglasses:

My name is Stefan Fitoussi and I a junior web developer, having participated in the remote [Neue Fische](https://www.neuefische.de/)-bootcamp _WEB DEVELOPER_ from September to December 2022, now looking for a place to work.

In my freetime I like to dive into my preferred hobbies, such as:
- **meeting friends**
- **tv documentaries**
- **fitness excercise**
- **reading**
- **videogames**

Exploring something new has always been one of my favorite things to do, so the challenge of the past web development course was exciting and the emphasis on teamwork is productive and fun.

And here is a funny seal for you!
