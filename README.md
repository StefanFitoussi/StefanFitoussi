# Welcome world! This is my GitHub-Hub B)

My name is Stefan Fitoussi and I am an upcoming web developer, currently participating in the remote [Neue Fische](https://www.neuefische.de/)-bootcamp _WEB DEVELOPER_.

In my freetime I like to dive into my preferred hobbies, such as:
- **meeting friends**
- **tv documentaries**
- **fitness excercise**
- **reading**
- **videogames**

Exploring something new has always been one of my favorite things to do, so the challenge of this web development course is exciting and the emphasis on teamwork is productive and fun.
